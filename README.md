# Comeonin [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/elixircnx/comeonin.svg?branch=master "Build Status")](https://travis-ci.org/elixircnx/comeonin) [![Hex.pm Version](http://img.shields.io/hexpm/v/comeonin.svg)](https://hex.pm/packages/comeonin)

Password authorization (bcrypt, pbkdf2_sha512) library for Elixir.

This library is intended to make it very straightforward for developers
to authorize users in as secure a manner as possible.

Comeonin now supports `bcrypt` and `pbkdf2_sha512`.

## Features

* Comeonin uses the most secure, up-to-date hashing schemes.
* It is easy to use.
    * There are several convenience functions to make authorizing users easier.
    * Salts are generated by default.
    * Each function has sensible, secure defaults.
* It provides good documentation.

## Installation

1. Add comeonin to your `mix.exs` dependencies

  ```elixir
  defp deps do
    [ {:comeonin, "~> 0.3"} ]
  end
  ```

2. List `:comeonin` as an application dependency

  ```elixir
  def application do
    [applications: [:logger, :comeonin]]
  end
  ```

3. Run `mix do deps.get, compile`

## Usage

Either import or alias the algorithm you want to use -- either `Comeonin.Bcrypt`
or `Comeonin.Pbkdf2`.

Both algorithms use similar naming conventions so as to make it easy to switch
between them. Both have the `hashpwsalt` function, which is a convenience
function that automatically generates a salt and then hashes the password.

To hash a password with the default options:

    hash = hashpwsalt("difficult2guess")

See each module's documentation for more information about
all the available options.

To check a password against the stored hash, use the `checkpw`
function. This takes two arguments: the plaintext password and
the stored hash:

    checkpw(password, stored_hash)

There is also a `dummy_checkpw` function, which takes no arguments
and is to be used when the username cannot be found. It performs a hash,
but then returns false. This can be used to make user enumeration more
difficult.

## Documentation

http://hexdocs.pm/comeonin

## Requirements

OTP version 17.3 or later

## Status

The bcrypt implementation is based on the latest OpenBSD version, which
fixed a small issue that affected some passwords longer than 72 characters.
It has been thoroughly tested in a development environment, but it has
not had much testing in production.

Comeonin has been tested on Linux, OS X and FreeBSD, but it has not been tested
on Windows. If you have any problems with the build, please let us know.
