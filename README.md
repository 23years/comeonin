Password hashing library for Elixir.

This library is intended to make it very straightforward for developers to check users'
passwords in as secure a manner as possible.

Comeonin supports Argon2, Bcrypt and Pbkdf2 (sha512 and sha256).

## Features

* Comeonin supports the most secure, well-tested, and up-to-date password hashing schemes.
    * Argon2 is the winner of the 2015 Password Hashing Competition.
    * Bcrypt and Pbkdf2 have no known vulnerabilities and have been widely tested for over 15 years.
* It is easy to use.
    * Salts are generated by default.
    * Each function has sensible, secure defaults.
* It provides excellent documentation.
    * Clear instructions are given on how to use Comeonin.
    * Several recommendations are also given to help developers keep their apps secure.

## Installation and Use

First, you need to decide which algorithm to use (see
[Choosing an algorithm](https://github.com/riverrun/comeonin/wiki/Choosing-the-password-hashing-algorithm)
for more information):

    * Argon2 - [argon2_elixir](https://github.com/riverrun/argon2_elixir)
    * Bcrypt - [bcrypt_elixir](https://github.com/riverrun/bcrypt_elixir)
    * Pbkdf2 - [pbkdf2_elixir](https://github.com/riverrun/pbkdf2_elixir)

If you choose Argon2 or Bcrypt, you will need to have a C compiler installed.
Argon2 also requires dirty scheduler support, which is provided by default
in Erlang 20. You do not need to have a C compiler installed to use Pbkdf2.

Then add `comeonin` and the library (algorithm) you choose to the `deps` section
of your `mix.exs` file, as in the following example.

      defp deps do
        [
          {:comeonin, "~> 4.0"},
          {:bcrypt_elixir, "~> 0.12.0"},
        ]
      end

For more information about how to use Comeonin, see the
[Comeonin wiki](https://github.com/riverrun/comeonin/wiki) for details.
The wiki also offers useful information about password hashing research.
